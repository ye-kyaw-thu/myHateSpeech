myHateSpeech: Myanmar hate speech datasets and experiments.

Today, social media platforms—especially Facebook—are widely used by Myanmar people for communication, information sharing, and news updates in their native language. However, this has also led to a rise in harmful content, including hate speech, disinformation, and misinformation.

To address this issue, **the Language Understanding Lab, Myanmar** is actively developing Myanmar-language hate speech corpora and conducting NLP experiments, such as hate speech keyword extraction and hate speech classification.

This repository (**myHateSpeech**) will share:

- Work-in-progress hate speech datasets
- Experimental logs & results
- Related academic publications

*Note: Datasets may vary in format and size across releases.*
